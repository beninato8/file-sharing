# Graphs

## Terminology

 - Undirected Graphs
   - Verticies, Edges
   - No duplicates (Usually)
   - can have self edges
   - Degree of vertex = number of edges
   - Path = sequece of verticies that follows edge connections
   - detect cycles, make sure no loops
 - Directed Graphs
   - Edges have directions
   - Travel from source to target
   - in degree is incoming edges
   - out degree is outgoing edges
   - degree is sum of in degree and out degree
   - path is set of verticies that follow direction
   - invalid doesn't follow directions
 - size is number of edges

## Implementation

 - depends on user application
 - graph constructor is empty
```
insert(vertex) add vertex, node edges
insert(vertex a, vertex b) add an edge between a and b
delete(vertex) remove vertex
delete(vertex a, vertex b) removed edge between a and b
lookup(vertex) label
lookup(vertex a, vertex b)
is empty, getsize, getorder

```

## Graph Class

```

public class Graph<T> { //T is vertex label
  List<Graphnode<T>> vertexList;
  boolean [][] edgeadjacentmatrix
}

```
