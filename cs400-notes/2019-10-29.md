# Adjacency Matrix

 - store edges in a 2D array
 - add array to the Graph class
 - add AM index to the Graphnode class

## Storage

 - Rows are the from (src) vertex
 - Cols are the to (target) vertex

### Directed Graph

|| 0|1 |2 | 3| 4|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 0| |T | | | T|
|1| | |T | | T|
|2 | |T | | | |
|3 | | |T | | T|
|4 | | | |T | |

### Undirected Graph

||A|B|C | D| E|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|A| |T | | |T|
|B| T| |T | |T |
|C| | T| |T | |
|D| | | T| |T |
|E|T |T | |T | |

# Adjacency List

 - store edges in ajacency list in Graphnode class
 - add accessors and mutators

## Storage

Each row is the from (src) vertex

### Directed Graph

|1| 2|
|2| 1|
|3| 2,4|

# Compute Degree of Vertex

## Adjacency List (degree of vertex)

 - "out degree" for **Direced** graph
 - "out + in degree" for **Undirected** graph

```java
public int degree (Graphnode<T> n) {
    //O(1) lookup
    return n.getAdjeacencyList().size();
}
```

## Adjacency Matrix (degree of vertex)

 - "out degree" for **Directed** graph
 - "out + in degree" for **Undirected** graph

```java
// PRE-CONDITION: AM is the Graph's adjacency matrix (boolean[][]) 
public int degree ( Graphnode<T> n ) {
    //count number of True values in a row
    int row = n.getAMindex();
    int degree = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < AM[row].length; i++)
    {
        if (AM[row][i])
            degree++;
    }
    return degree;
}
```

# Comparison of Edge Representations

 - Ease of implementation: very easy (for both)
 Space (memory)

## Space

|Adjacency Matrix | Adjacency List|
|-|-|
| O(V^2)|O(V+E) |

## Time Complexity

 - insert(v), insert(v, v), lookup(v), lookup(v, v), remove(v), remove(v, v)
 - Depends on implementation and which operations are required


## Degree of Node

|Adjacency Matrix | Adjacency List|
|-|-|
| O(V)|O(1) |

## Does Edge Exist?

|Adjacency Matrix | Adjacency List|
|-|-|
| O(1)|O(E) |

# Searches and Traversals

## Search

 - Look through Graph for vertex of edge
 - Stop when found or visited all nodes
 - Start at a specified vertex

## Traversal
- visit all nodes
- must specify a start
- visit only reachable verticies
-
